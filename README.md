# Data-Science-Salaries-Analysis
In this Repo, I used Jupyter notebook to explore trends &amp; salaries in data science.
I explored the data using the following steps:
1.	Installing and importing required libraries
2.	Uploading the data
3.	Understanding the data: Shape, info, Unique values, 
4.	Top 10 job titles in 2023 using bar plot
5.	Understanding the different Experience Levels, Visualizing Level of Experience vs No of Employees
6.	Analyzing Employment types vs No of Employees
7.	Analyzing Average Salaries by job titles
8.	Analyzing Average Salaries by employment types
9.	Average Salaries by work years
10.	Remote job by locations
