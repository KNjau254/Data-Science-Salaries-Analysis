# Data-Science-Salaries-Analysis
In this Repo, I used Jupyter notebook to explore trends &amp; salaries in data science.
I explored the data using the following steps:
1.	Installing and importing required libraries
2.	Uploading the data
3.	Understanding the data: Shape, info, Unique values, 
4.	Top 10 job titles in 2023 using bar plot
5.	Understanding the different Experience Levels, Visualizing Level of Experience vs No of Employees
6.	Analyzing Employment types vs No of Employees
7.	Analyzing Average Salaries by job titles
8.	Analyzing Average Salaries by employment types
9.	Average Salaries by work years
10.	Remote job by locations


Some insights from the Analysis;

1.	The analysis indicates that data engineering is the most common role, followed by data science.
2.	Senior-level positions have the highest count, with mid-level and junior positions following closely behind. The number of director-level positions is lower than the other levels.
3.	The majority of full-time employees are at the senior level, with freelancing being less prevalent these days.
4.	The analysis confirms that executive-level positions have higher average salaries, with cloud data architect being the second highest paid profession due to the trend of cloud computing.
5.	Over the years, the average salaries for full-time positions have increased, indicating companies' growing interest in data science. The second highest average salary is for freelancers, indicating a trend towards freelance work.
6.	The average salary for data-driven jobs is increasing every year, with a significant jump observed between 2021 and 2022. This trend highlights the growing demand for skilled professionals in this field.

In conclusion, the analysis demonstrates that Data Science is a highly sought-after and rapidly growing field. The graphs clearly indicate the continued popularity of data science.
